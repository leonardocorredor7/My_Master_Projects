# MYMASTERPROJECTS

Hello all,

This repository contains a curated selection of data science projects
developed during my Master’s studies.

Each project originates from academic coursework but has been independently
developed, analyzed, and documented to form a coherent personal portfolio.
The focus is on applied data analysis, exploratory techniques, and clear
communication of results using Python, R, Jupyter, and Quarto.

Projects cover topics including public health, economics, energy markets,
and transportation data.

I hope you enjoy my work.

Sincerly,
Leonardo Corredor
