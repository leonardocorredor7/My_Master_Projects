# Macroeconomic Data Analysis (1980–2020)

## Personal Context

This project is part of my personal data science portfolio and was originally
developed as coursework during my Master’s program in Data Science.

In addition to the course requirements, I focused on:
- handling and transforming long-term macroeconomic time series
- cross-country comparative analysis
- visualization of trends and structural changes
- interpretation of economic indicators in a data-driven manner

This project analyzes long-term macroeconomic indicators across multiple
countries, emphasizing trend analysis, cross-country comparison, and
economic interpretation based on data.
